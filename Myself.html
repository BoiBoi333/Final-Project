<p>  Hello there and I appreciate that you are visiting my digital profile
My name is Kyle Raymondo, and I'm currently a junior at Buchanan High School. 
I attend the Center for Advanced Research and Technology (CART) to decide what kind of career choices I want to choose for my future. 
I chose this because I thought it would be something new to learn and also a job I would like to be doing in the future. 
I am currently enrolled in the Web Application Development lab and hope to move on to Game Design next year to put my coding skills to use. 
I donâ€™t have any plans right now after highschool but I want it to involve coding.
<p>
