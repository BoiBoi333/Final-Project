<h1>Video Game Essay</h1>

<p>The career that seems interesting to do is Video Game Design. There are so many things about being a videogame designer that just sound fun.
     Making games so other people have fun makes you feel good because you know that a lot of people want to play your game. 
     A lot of people aren’t happy with their jobs but making games is a good job. You’re getting paid for something you love to do. 
     Something that is good about game design is you can use your creativity. There are a lot of things about games when they need ideas for updates or events in games. 
     If you’re someone who has a creative mind then this job is for you. There are a lot of things that game designers have to do to make their game. 
     They have to come up with what kind of game they want to create. Then they have to figure out the main parts of the game. What kind of setting and story will be in the game.
      The characters have to fit the kind of game or it won’t make any sense. They have to have scripting language and artistic vision for the game.
       Designers must work with artists and programmers to make this happen. Duties that game designers have to do include characters,levels,puzzles,art and animation. 
    The kind of environments that video game designers work in is an office. They either work in their own office or they work in cubicles. They work 40 hours per week. 
    If they need to work longer then they will. Most video game designers do work from home because making games takes a very long game so working on it at home is going to be required. 
    Game designers can pretty much work from anywhere as long as they have a computer to work on it. A lot of games take longer than expected so they will have to work on times that they may on want to work on.
    Some qualities that you need for this job is a genuine interest in gaming. There is no reason to make games if you’re not even interested in them. If you’re a big fan of games then this is for you. 
    Another quality to have is good problem solving. This is an important quality because if there's a problem or a change that needs to be made with the game and you come up with it then you will make a lot of people happy.
     Skills and patience are important because your skills will come in handy for making the game. Patience is another because making a game is not easy.
    For video game design the minimum requirement is a school diploma. What you may need is a working experience in computer science, programming, or art. 
    Some key skills to have is creativity and the ability to tell a story. This is because video games have a storyline so if you can tell a story then you’re able to make up a storyline for a video game. In the degree field you need to have video game design. 
    The degree level is of course a high school diploma. Your experience should be a professional portfolio. Internships are also another way for your experience. 
    Video game designers make up to about 40k-60k a year. In California they make up to 40k-120k a year. Some things that affect game designers are the studio size. Bigger companies usually have big project budgets. 
    This allows them to pay their game designers higher salaries. For the education background game designers usually come in the industry throughout many different paths. 
    If your game does really well you could earn up to an extra %50 of your salary on top of your salary. There is a drawback about bonuses and this is that they are not always guaranteed. This is if your game does not do very well.
    The overall outlook for being a videogame designer has gone down since 2004. It has decreased by 32.3 percent nationwide. With this number that’s about 5.39 percent every year. Demand for videogame designers is expected to go up. 
    It’s expected that 7,940 new jobs will be filled by 2018. This number represents an annual increase of about 11.59 percent in the next few years. The video game industry is one of the few jobs that is continuing to grow.
    The main reason is because of our technology. It continues to grow everyday making it eaiser to make games. 	One educational path or being a videogame designer is a high school diploma. This is the minimum requirement to becoming a videogame designer.
     Something else you may need is you have to have experience working in computer science. You don’t need to major in anything, you just need a high school diploma and experience in working in computer science. No college would offer a major for this because you don’t need to have a major. 
     You can major in a computer design class but you don’t need to. Same thing for institutions because you don’t have to have a major. Just a high school diploma or experience in computer science.
    Being a videogame designer would be a lot of fun. It’s the type of job that I would personally enjoy. I am a very creative person. When talking about games I have good ideas that would make games nowadays more fun. 
    Making games and putting your ideas in them seems like more fun because you get to put what you want in it. Having a full team of creative people is even better because everyone is putting in ideas and making the game better. I will continue to pursue this career in the future. 
    This job sounds like something that is made for me. I wanted a job and still want a job that involves games. Something that's really interesting about video game design is how people come up with the ideas for a game. I’ve always wondered how people come up with the start of some of my favorite games.
