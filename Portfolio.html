    <p> With HTML making websites like these are really nice. It's easy to learn and do.
       Google Docs and Slides are good to use for notes or work you need to do later.
       Google Classroom is where you do work that is assigned to you.
       With Visual Code Studios coding websites is not a problem. </p>
    <p> You can make and put whatever you want on it. It's good if you want to show someone something or maybe if you 
       want a job in making websites. Github and Netlify are used so someone can look at what you did in your coding and Netlifyis where you will 
       publish your code so if someone went to that website they can see it.
       Lucidchart is good for planning what you are going to do with upcoming projects.
